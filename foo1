Survey of how suite/schedule works today

Customer creates schedule using editor in eclipse.
UI calls into classes like ThinkTimeOptionsControl.
ThinkTime is an interface which appears to be generated code.
ThinkTimeImpl implements the interface.
Persistence is achieved using EMF.

EMF tooling allows you to create UML diagrams.  With it you can model
a data model and generate code or other output.

Codegen takes the EMF model and produces Java classes that represent
a feature like Think and includes all the attributes.  The attributes
are essentially name/value pairs.

Engine runtime kernel contains a KThink.java class that has methods
for setting attributes and includes an execute() method to perform
the desired action.
